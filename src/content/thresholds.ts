/**
 * The guides that answer "how do I get VT1 and VT2 out of my CPET file": one
 * general page and one per vendor whose exports Oxynet was built on.
 *
 * Why they exist: on 2026-10-28 a web search for the questions a person puts
 * to an assistant ("AI tool to find VT1 VT2 from CPET file", "analyse COSMED
 * CPET export ventilatory thresholds") returned the Oxynet papers and never
 * this site, so the assistant concluded that no ready-made tool exists. The
 * baseline and the monthly re-check are in the orchestration repo,
 * docs/visibility.md.
 *
 * A vendor gets a page only when core's parser was built and checked on that
 * vendor's real exports. PNOE and VO2 Master are named in FORMAT_INFO but have
 * no example file in core's corpus or tests (UNVERIFIED_FORMATS in
 * tests/test_parser_formats.py), and a VO2 Master export carries no CO2
 * channel, so the thresholds cannot run on it. Vyaire is unconfirmed. None of
 * the three gets a page until a real file proves it.
 *
 * `handles` is restated from the comments in core's loaders
 * (oxynet/data/parser.py: _load_cosmed, _load_brescia and the _load_cortex*
 * family). Public wording omits cohort codes and institution names, as
 * content/developers/formats.ts does.
