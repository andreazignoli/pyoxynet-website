    'Is it free?',
    <>
      The browser needs no account. Assistants and code need an API key, and a{' '}
      <a href={LINKS.signup}>free key</a> takes a minute, with a monthly limit stated on the sign-up page.
      For more, or for clinical use under a data processing agreement,{' '}
      <a href={MAILTO.key}>ask for an organisation key</a>.
    </>,
  ],
  [
    'Does the AI decide where the threshold is?',
    <>
      No. The assistant passes the file to Oxynet and explains the result. The thresholds come from
      Oxynet&apos;s models, which were trained on tests that experts labelled. An assistant without Oxynet
      will estimate a threshold from the numbers, and it will sound right.
    </>,
  ],
  [
    'Is there a confidence score?',
    <>
      No, and none is invented. Agreement with expert raters is published; nothing is calibrated against
      clinical outcomes. What the response does describe is the recording: whether the gas analysis,
      sampling and clock can support a measurement.
    </>,
  ],
  [
    'What happens to the file?',
    <>
      The uploaded bytes are parsed and discarded. The parsed record expires after {RETENTION_HOURS} hours,
      and records are kept apart per API key. The browser keeps nothing beyond your session. Details on{' '}
      <Link href="/developers/data-handling">data handling</Link>.
    </>,
  ],
  [
    'Can I upload patient data?',
    <>
      On a free key, de-identified data only. An organisation that needs more works under a data processing
      agreement. Either way Oxynet is research software, not a medical device: its results are not a
      diagnosis and must not be used to make medical decisions about a person.

            An AI assistant asked to read a CPET will estimate a threshold from the numbers in front of it, and
            the answer will sound right. Connected to Oxynet it does not: it routes the file and explains what
            comes back. The thresholds come from models trained on tests that experts labelled, across cohorts
            that differ in population, protocol, ergometer and metabolic cart. The agreement is published:
