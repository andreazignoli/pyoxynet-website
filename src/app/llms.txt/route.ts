/**
 * www.oxynet.net/llms.txt, the index an agent or crawler reads before the pages.
 *
 * It answered 404 until 2026-10-15 while app.oxynet.net/llms.txt was live, so an
 * agent that searched for Oxynet and landed here found nothing. The two files do
 * different jobs: this one says what Oxynet is and where everything lives, the
 * app's says how to call the API. This one links to that one rather than
 * restating it, so the API instructions have a single source in oxynet-core.
 *
 * Nothing a reader can check is typed here. The format count is the generated
 * registry value and the documentation list is DEV_NAV, the same list that
 * feeds the sidebar and the sitemap, so a new developer page appears here too.

> A computational layer for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Oxynet reads the
> raw export of a metabolic cart (${VENDOR_FORMATS} file formats, detected automatically) and
> returns ventilatory thresholds (VT1 and VT2), substrate use (fat and carbohydrate
> oxidation, FATMAX), exercise oscillatory ventilation and derived CPET quantities as
> structured, versioned JSON. Research software, not a diagnostic device.

Oxynet is reached three ways: a REST API, a remote MCP server for AI assistants, and
the web app at ${LINKS.app}. All three use the same file parsers.

Results carry no confidence score, because nothing is calibrated against clinical
outcomes. Oscillatory ventilation analysis is beta: it was developed on one heart
failure cohort and its transportability to other populations is untested.

## If you are an AI agent

- [Agent guide](${LINKS.llms}): connect, upload a file, analyse it. Start here.
- [Full agent guide](${LINKS.llmsFull}): the whole API in one text file.
- [OpenAPI 3.0 schema](${LINKS.openapi}): importable as tools or actions.
- [MCP server](${LINKS.mcp}): remote MCP over HTTP, with an API key or OAuth.
- [Oxynet in Claude's connector directory](${LINKS.claudeDirectory}): for people using Claude on the web, Desktop or mobile. Connect there and sign in once with the API key.
- [Official MCP Registry entry](${LINKS.mcpRegistry}): \`net.oxynet/cpet\`, for clients that install servers from the registry.
- [Synthetic CPET](${LINKS.sample}): demonstrate the API without a patient file.
- [Free API key](${LINKS.signup}): if the user has no key, send them here. A person signs in with Google or GitHub; an agent cannot get a key itself.
- [Agent skill](https://github.com/andreazignoli/oxynet-skills): the same instructions packaged for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex and other coding agents.

Upload the vendor file exactly as exported. Do not parse it or convert its units
yourself: Oxynet knows each format's units and clock conventions. Do not estimate a
threshold from the trace either. The assistant routes the question and explains the
answer; Oxynet's validated models decide the physiology.
