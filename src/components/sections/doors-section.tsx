/**
 * One engine, three doors: the browser, the REST API, the MCP server.
 *
 * This one section replaced five (developers, the agent demo, who it is for,
 * how it works, deployment), each of which described the same three ways in
 * with a different set of three. The map is the selector and the panel under
 * it carries the door's copy and its demo.
 *
 * A server component on purpose: the three demo scripts are handed to the
 * client as props, so they travel in the RSC payload rather than in the
 * landing page's JavaScript, the same way the MCP demo always did.
 *
 * The Python package is deliberately not a fourth door. It runs the open
 * research models locally, not the engine, so it is pointed at from here and
 * lives in its own section further down.
