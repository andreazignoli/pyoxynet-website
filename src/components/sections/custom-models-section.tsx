/**
 * Models fine-tuned on one lab's tests.
 *
 * Every step below is what core's training pipeline does today
 * (`docs/pipeline.md`): pretrain on every contributing lab, keep the encoder,
 * retrain the head on one lab's recordings, run the promotion gate, register
 * the model under a name the API and the MCP server accept, and scope keys to
 * it. Cohort codes and the names of the labs that already have one stay out of
 * public copy.
 *
 * The gate for a lab model is run against that lab's own labelled tests, so
 * this section does not claim "a cohort it never saw" the way the validation
 * section does for the general models, and it says outright that a model
 * fitted to one lab is not evidence that it transports.
