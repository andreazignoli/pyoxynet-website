# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Oxynet marketing site — a Next.js 14 site for Oxynet, a computational layer
that turns cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) signals into structured physiological
measurements.

- **Branch:** `main` (active development; ahead of `next`, which is stale)
- **Legacy:** `gh-pages` (old Jekyll site, kept for reference)
- **Domain:** `www.oxynet.net` (DNS pointed to Vercel)

## The sister repo: this is not the only Oxynet property

`app.oxynet.net` is the product; this site is the front door to it. It is built from
`oxynet-interpreter-tf2/ui` (React + Vite) in a separate repository, and the two are
deliberately indistinguishable to a visitor who moves between them.

**The design tokens are duplicated on purpose and must be changed in both places:**

| Token | Value | Here | App |
|---|---|---|---|
| Background | `#0a0a0a` | `--background` in `globals.css` | `ink-950` |
| Card / surface | `#121212` | `--card` | `ink-900` |
| Border | `#242424` | `--border` | `ink-800` |
| Muted text | `#8c8c8c` | `--muted-foreground` | `ink-500` |
| Accent | `#00dc82` | `accent.DEFAULT` | `brand-400` |
| Gradient | `#00dc82 → #155799` | `.gradient-text` | `.gradient-text` |
| Type | Geist Sans + Geist Mono | `geist/font` | Google Fonts |
| Intensity domains | moderate `#34d399`, heavy `#fbbf24`, severe `#f87171` | `content/demos/mcp-demo.ts` | `CpetScatterChart.tsx` |

`.glass` is defined identically in both repos. The **mark** is generated from
`oxynet/api/assets/oxynet-icon.svg` in the app repo into `src/components/shared/duck-mark.tsx`
here. It is inlined rather than an `<img>` because the path is drawn with `currentColor`,
which cannot inherit across document boundaries. Regenerate rather than hand-edit.

## Positioning: read before writing copy

The narrative is **measurement, not classification**. Oxynet is sold as a computational
layer that extracts physiological structure from CPET signals; VT1/VT2 is the entry
product, not the ceiling. Six rules that have been decided:

1. **Do not sell the AI.** Deep learning, Keras, TensorFlow and TFLite are the mechanism.
   A hospital or a device manufacturer is buying a new capability to interpret CPET, not
   a model architecture. Keep the stack talk in the package section, where researchers
   are the audience.
2. **The app is the destination.** Every product CTA points at `app.oxynet.net`.
   Exercise Thresholds remains credited in the footer acknowledgments and nowhere else.
3. **No em dashes in anything a user or an agent reads.** Not in the site copy, not in
   the app UI, not in the served text documents. Use a full stop, a comma, a colon or
   parentheses. The one exception is the bare dash used as an empty-cell placeholder in a
   data table, which is a symbol rather than punctuation. This is a standing house-style
   rule and applies to the sister repo too.
4. **Keep the copy punchy.** "A computational layer for CPET", "Physiological intelligence
   for exercise testing", "One engine, three doors" and similar lines are wanted. Plainer
   is not automatically better here. Cut a line when it claims something untrue, not
   because it has energy.
5. **The model must not improvise physiology.** An LLM asked to read a CPET will
   estimate a threshold from the trace, and it will sound right. The reason the MCP
   server exists is to stop that: the assistant routes the question and explains the
   answer, the validated models decide the physiology. Copy about agents should say
   which of the two did what, and never imply the assistant worked it out.
6. **Never invent confidence.** Nothing is calibrated against clinical outcomes, so no
   percentage confidence appears anywhere. Oscillation analysis is beta, developed on a
   single heart-failure cohort, with transportability untested. Say so wherever it is
   mentioned rather than in one buried footnote.

## The manual

`manual/` builds a 31-page A4 PDF describing the engine, published at `/manual`
and linked from the navbar and the footer. It is a separate pipeline from the
site: plain ES modules producing HTML strings, printed by the Chrome already on
the machine, so there is no bundled browser to download.

```bash
npm run manual        # build, check every page fits, print the PDF
npm run manual:check  # build + the overflow check, no PDF
```

**Read `manual/README.md` before editing it, and `manual/REVISING.md` before
starting a round of revision: one round of feedback produces exactly one version
bump, with one changelog entry.** Three things there are not
guessable: page numbers live only in `manual/toc.mjs`; every page must finish
above y=1050 and `manual/fit.mjs` fails the build if one does not; and
`-webkit-background-clip: text` must never be used, because Chrome drops the
text clip when printing and the wordmark comes out as a solid rectangle.

Every number in Part Two is a real response from the live API, recorded in
`manual/data/api-results.json` against the de-identified recording in
`manual/data/reference-test.json`. Page 2 states that nothing in the document is
simulated, so those numbers must be refreshed from the API rather than edited by
hand. The API reference is deliberately a link rather than generated content;
the CI job that would render an endpoint appendix is noted as a gap in the
README and `config.mjs` isolates the engine snapshot ready for it.

## The demos

The MCP demo is a cinematic, browser-only animation of an AI agent reaching
Oxynet. It lives on the landing page as `McpDemoSection`, under the developer
section that makes the claim it carries out. Its anchor is **`agent-demo`**,
not `demo`: that id belongs to the before/after slider higher up the page, and
the rail already names that one "Demo".

It is the first of a family (interface, API, MCP), so it is built as a player
plus a script rather than as one animation:

- `src/content/demos/types.ts` is the contract: a demo is a list of `DemoEvent`s,
  each carrying its own `durationMs`. Nothing in `src/components/demo/` knows what
  a ventilatory threshold is.
- `src/content/demos/mcp-demo.ts` is the whole story: dialogue, tool calls,
  latencies, results, threshold values, pacing. A second demo is a second file
  registered in `src/content/demos/index.ts` and rendered by the same player.
- `src/hooks/use-demo-timeline.ts` reveals event `i` at the sum of the durations
  before it, and knows nothing else.
- `src/lib/demo-invoker.ts` holds the seam. Tool results arrive through a
  `ToolInvoker` promise, so replacing the scripted one with a live MCP client is a
  prop on `<DemoPlayer>`, not a rewrite.

**The agent never discovers anything.** The narrative is: connect your provider
to the Oxynet MCP server, then ask it to analyse a CPET with Oxynet
capabilities. The run opens on the reader attaching a spreadsheet and asking,
and the connected server appears *inside the agent's turn*, after it says it
will look at what tools it has. No copy anywhere may suggest the assistant went
looking for a physiological engine and happened to find one. Someone chose
Oxynet; everything after that is what the choice buys.

**The reader's line is set larger than the agent's**, and there is no standing
tool inventory beside the transcript. Both were tried the other way. A rail
listing ten tools and their summaries was the most detailed thing on screen and
the least important, and it pulled the eye out of the conversation, which is
the only thing the section is selling.

**The player is lazily mounted and must stay that way.** It pulls in Framer
Motion, the chart and the script, which put about 32 kB on the landing page's
First Load JS (229 kB to 261 kB) for a section several screens down that does
not animate until scrolled to. `demo-player-lazy.tsx` fetches it once the
reader is within 600 px and holds the space with a skeleton until then, which
puts the page back to 231 kB. Import `DemoPlayerLazy` on the landing page, not
`DemoPlayer`.

**The window is 4:5 (34rem wide), not a wide console.** It is meant to be
screen-recorded and posted, and a 16:9 developer console crops to nothing in a
LinkedIn feed. On a wide page the copy sits beside it and takes the space the
window gives back. Anything added to the stage has to survive at 544px.

**The MCP surface in the script is checked against `scripts/mcp_server.py` in
the interpreter repo and must stay that way.** Ten tools, in the order the
server declares them. Three things there are easy to get wrong and are wrong in
any script that guesses: `get_capabilities` is called first, because the
analyses are licensed separately; a file named by path goes through
`create_upload` and then a **curl**, because Oxynet mints a one-shot URL rather
than taking bytes through the conversation; and `analyze_cpet` returns a
`quality` that describes the recording, never a confidence in the answer. The
demo says so out loud, and the values are invented, which is what the
"simulated interaction" line under the window is for.

The chart is the app's VT view, not a new picture. Two panels share one VO2
axis: breath-by-breath VE on top, every point coloured by the domain the model
assigned it, and the un-stacked zone probabilities underneath, drawn as
`ProbabilityTraceChart` draws them. There is deliberately **no fitted line**
through the scatter, because a regression a reader could have drawn themselves
would say the opposite of what the section says. The dashed threshold lines run
through both panels, because the point of stacking them is that the crossings
are the thresholds: moderate meets heavy at VT1, heavy meets severe at VT2. One
probability function feeds both the point colours and the traces, and the
marker positions come from the VO2 numbers in the script, so editing a
threshold moves the crossing, the colour change and the label together. The rest of the stage uses the fixed `demo.*`
palette in `tailwind.config.ts` rather than the themed ink ramp, so it stays
dark when the page is in the light theme.

### Sharing it

Three surfaces, one script and one component behind all of them:

```bash
npm run build && npm run clip   # writes oxynet-mcp-demo.mp4, 1080x1372
CLIP_WIDTH=1080 CLIP_MS=48000 npm run clip
```

- `/demo` is the link to send someone. It carries its own OpenGraph card at
  `public/og-agent-demo.png`, so pasting the URL into LinkedIn or an email
  unfurls with the chart rather than with the site's default hero.
- `/demo/clip` is the recording stage: no navbar, no page ground, no disclosure
  line, the window pinned to a fixed height and rendered at 2x. Nobody should
  land on it, hence `robots: noindex`.
- `scripts/record-clip.mjs` serves the production build, takes a CDP
  screencast, and encodes with the ffmpeg on the machine. It **measures** the
  window and crops to it, so the output ratio follows the component: change the
  header and the clip still frames correctly. Frames arrive on paint rather than
  on a clock, so ffmpeg gets a concat list with real per-frame durations; a
  fixed frame rate drifts against the animation.

To screenshot rather than record, drive Chrome over CDP on the wall clock and
scroll the section into view first (the player starts on `useInView`).
`--virtual-time-budget` fast-forwards the timers but leaves Framer Motion
unstarted, so the capture comes back blank. And never pipe `next build` into
`head`: the SIGPIPE kills it mid-write and leaves `.next` unusable.

### Key Architecture Decisions

**Server/Client boundary for code tabs:**
`usage-section.tsx` is an async Server Component that pre-renders all Shiki HTML and passes the strings to `usage-tabs.tsx` (Client Component with Radix Tabs). Shiki never ships to the client.

**Shiki singleton:**
`src/lib/shiki.ts` creates one `Highlighter` instance reused across requests. Theme: `github-dark-dimmed`, langs: `python`, `sh`, `bash`.

**Glass morphism utility:**
The `.glass` class is defined in `globals.css` — `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.04)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`.

### Design Tokens
- Background: `#0a0a0a` (CSS var `--background`)
- Accent green: `#00dc82` (Tailwind `accent.DEFAULT`)
- Secondary blue: `#155799` (Tailwind `accent.blue`)
- Gradient text: `#00dc82 → #155799`

## Deployment

The site deploys automatically on Vercel from the `next` branch.

To run locally:
```bash
npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

To deploy:
```bash
git push origin main   # Vercel picks it up automatically
```

Confirm the production branch in the Vercel dashboard before pushing — the project was
originally wired to `next`, and `main` has since become the branch carrying the work.

### DNS / Domain
Point `www.oxynet.net` to Vercel using the A records or CNAME provided in the Vercel dashboard under "Domains".
