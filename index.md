## About the Oxynet Project

Universal access to high-quality healthcare is a global challenge. Leveraging AI and vast data resources, *Oxynet* aims to revolutionize the diagnosis of medical conditions through CPET, facilitating accurate and timely clinical decisions while reducing costs associated with diagnostic errors and delays.

*Oxynet* combines:

- A network of CPET experts
- A large crowdsourced dataset
- AI algorithms approximating human cognition in CPET analysis

We seek collaboration with universities, hospitals, clinics, medical professionals, and companies involved in medical device development and commercialization. Together, we can advance R&D, support research financially, contribute to scientific publications, share data, develop web applications, conduct market analyses, and validate algorithms for clinical use.

## The *Pyoxynet* Package

*Pyoxynet* is a suite of deep neural network algorithms designed for CPET data analysis. Built with [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), the models are available in TFLite format for efficiency, with direct TensorFlow model usage from version 11.6 onward.

The package includes two main models:

- **Inference Model:** Estimates exercise intensity domains from CPET data.
- **Generator Model:** Creates synthetic CPET data.

üêç [Install the Python package](https://pypi.org/project/pyoxynet/)  
üìÅ [Read the docs](https://pyoxynet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### Installation

*Pyoxynet* is compatible with **Python 3.8**. To install, run:

```sh
pip install pyoxynet
```

Or:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/andreazignoli/pyoxynet.git#subdirectory=pyoxynet
```

## Usage

To use the *inference* model, input CPET data including VO2, VCO2, VE, PetO2, PetCO2, VEVO2, and VEVCO2. *Pyoxynet* handles data interpolation, supporting sec-by-sec, breath-by-breath, and averaged data.

Example usage:

```python
import pyoxynet

# Load the TFL model
tfl_model = pyoxynet.load_tf_model()

# Make inference on a random input
test_tfl_model(tfl_model)

# Plot the inference on a test dataset
pyoxynet.test_pyoxynet()
```

## Generation

*Pyoxynet* includes a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) for generating realistic CPET data. Example:

```python
from pyoxynet import *

# Call the generator
generator = load_tf_generator()

# Generate a Pandas df with fake CPET data
df = generate_CPET(generator, plot=True)

# Call Oxynet for inference on fake data
test_pyoxynet(input_df=df)
```

Generated data includes VO2, VCO2, VE, HR, RF, PetO2, and PetCO2.
